# habits

A simple, web-based habit tracker.

**This is just my own personal software.** I use it a lot and am very satisifed with it, but there are no guarantees that this will work for you. It is suited to my own needs and idiosyncracies.

* The habit\_pause and habit\_weekday tables are unused. The related features turned out to be too complex and not very useful.
* The touch\_counter table is unused.

I did not bother to make it mobile-ready, since I only ever use it on desktop.

It SHOULD work under any webserver that has php and mysql enabled, apache or nginx or a similar server.


# Setup

To set it up:

1. Copy the source tree to a web-accessable location.
2. Inside the project root, run: "cp php/config.php.dist php/config.php"
3. Edit php/config.php to set the db config.
4. Set up the db.
5. Inside the project root, run mysql client on the db, and inside mysql, run: "source migrations/setup.sql"

Please do not be alarmed about the lack of any git history. I used my real name on the local repo, and I don't want to expose that to the world.
